This is my first post, I'm watching [WestWorld](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0475784/).
Hmmm still not sure about it, however it does have a great cast and premise.
Is it possible to watch some thing and write code.

Learn some Ruby.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('theWhiteFox')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
